Assignment 4: Geospatial/network/text visualization (10 points)
===============================================================

In this assignment, you will build a geospatial, network, or text visualization. You do not have to do all three, just pick one. That said, you can certainly use text data to form a network that you visualize, or use text data to build a map (see the notes for examples). It can be a single static visualization or an interactive graph/app. It's up to you to decide how complex you make it. Students who attempt more challenging visualizations will be rewarded in their evaluation.
